I've been struggling for quite some time to start creating stuff on the internet, feeling that I'm not prepared enough.

There was a lot of self-doubt and perfectionism involved in the process, which led me to abandon any ideas, thinking those are not *worthy* enough to be read.

But well... lowering the bar a little bit seemed to engage my creative juices.

This post was created.

`Why` mentioned in the title could be treated as a question. But there is a subtle detail missingâ€”a question mark.

Is it an oversight? Not really.

It's a statement.

You have to start with `why` in order to pursue something greater for a longer period of time. At least it seems so when watching people actually doing it.

I've tried to define it before, but social conditioning made it inherently difficult, spawning doubts and anxiousness.

My `why` is to challenge myself into sharing what I know with others without boring them, while growing and learning new stuff along the way.
