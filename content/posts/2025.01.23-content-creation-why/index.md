I've been struggling for quite some time to start creating stuff on the internet, feeling that I'm not prepared enough.
There was a lot of self-doubt and perfectionism involved in the process, which led me to abandon any ideas, thinking those are not *worthy* enough to be read.

But well... lowering the bar a little bit seemed to engage my creative juices. This post was created.

`Why` mentioned in the title can be treated as a question. You have to start with an answer to `why` in order to pursue something greater for a longer period of time. 

At least it seems so when watching people actually doing it.

I've tried to define it before, but my limiting beliefs made it inherently difficult, spawning doubts and anxiousness that it "could be better" and/or that "it's not good enough". But I'm growing tired of this relentless pursuit of being perceived in a certain way, and doing everything to avoid rejection. It's exhausting, and frankly—stupid.

This self-doubt loosened today. I'm not exactly sure whether content creation is a right direction, but I won't be able to find out without giving it a try.

So here it is, in the form that came to my mind today — my `why`.

My `why` is to challenge myself into sharing what I know with others without boring them, while growing and learning new stuff along the way.
